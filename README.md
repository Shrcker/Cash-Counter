As someone who struggles with executive dysfunction, I struggle to find applications that can help me keep track of funds, especially as many commercial offers tend to become fairly overcomplicated. Because of this, I decided to create a small application that can help me do just that, keep track of my cash on hand by helping me track each of my earnings and deductions.
